# recruiter-reply

## Summary

A static one page website that includes canned recruiter replies to make your life easier. If you're like me, you get canned recruiter emails that are so far off base from what you do, it's comical. Replying to these can waste lots of time, but what if you could just send a URL, along with an #anchor tag at the end of the URL so the recruiter gets their own "personalized" reply on the `recruiter-reply.html` webpage! **Note** this project is in no way trying to denegrate recruiters, since I know a lot of great ones that have done a lot for me and my 'career', but when I get the form letter 'Hi Phil' emails I really want a to give a form letter reply back, ya know? This way, we can. Enjoy, and contributions as pull requests welcome!
